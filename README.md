# WannaHide
WannaHide is a secure web-based chat application that leverages hybrid encryption with ElGamal and AES-256 CBC, combined with the Double Ratchet protocol. This design ensures both security and performance, using asymmetric encryption for key exchange and symmetric encryption for fast communication.

## Key Features:
* ElGamal Encryption for secure key exchange.
* AES-256 CBC for fast, symmetric message encryption.
* Double Ratchet Protocol for forward secrecy with unique keys per message.
